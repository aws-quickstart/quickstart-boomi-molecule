This Quick Start assumes familiarity with basic concepts of networking, bastion hosts, volume sizing, and compute performance. It also assumes familiarity with the  Boomi variables that are required when deploying a Molecule cluster. These variables include Molecule Name, Local Path, Local Temp Path, Account Id, Account Name, and Account Password. If you don’t have have an Account Name or Password, you can enter an installation token provided by your system administrator into the *Boomi MFA install token* field. 

If you are an administrator, see the following sections of this guide for help creating an installation token and API token:

* link:#_creating_an_api_token[Creating an API token]

NOTE: This Quick Start follows the patterns for Unattended Boomi Molecule deployments found in the Boomi documentation. See http://help.boomi.com/atomsphere/GUID-27BDD6B1-E6BD-48C9-8C6D-EC1B2CA60316.html[Unattended installation of an Atom, Molecule, or Atom Cloud^].
