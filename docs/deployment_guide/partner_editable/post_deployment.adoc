// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Donâ€™t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

=== Test the deployment
To view the Molecule on Boomi AtomSphere, log in to your https://platform.boomi.com/[Boomi account^]. On the *Manage*, choose *Atom Management*. The newly created Amazon EC2 instance Molecule cluster is displayed.

You can attach Molecules to any environment you have staged and deploy workloads to that Molecule cluster. On the Boomi dashboard, your deployed Molecule is under *Unattached Atoms*. For more information, refer to https://help.boomi.com/bundle/integration/page/t-atm-Attaching_an_Atom_to_an_Enviro.html[Attaching an Atom to or detaching an Atom from an environment^].

//== Best practices for using {partner-product-name} on AWS
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

//_Add any best practices for using the software._

=== Security
This Quick Start deploys a bastion host and a Boomi Molecule cluster into an AWS VPC. The bastion host is the only means of accessing the Boomi Molecule cluster at a command-line level. The Boomi Molecule cluster is deployed into private subnets and cannot be reached through the internet. The Boomi Molecule cluster communicates through a NAT Gateway for updates and patches, and it communicates through the public-facing Application Load Balancer to communicate with the  Boomi AtomSphere platform.

=== Performance monitoring

Monitoring the CPU, network, and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) performance of your AWS Boomi Molecule cluster is done through CloudWatch metrics.

CPU and network performance are measured in utilization, network in and out, network packets in and out, and system status checks.

Amazon EBS volume performance is measured in read and write throughput, average read and write size, read and write bandwidth, read and write latency, and volume idle time.

Amazon EFS reports metrics to CloudWatch and can be monitored there. Metrics include client connections, data read and data write bytes, and IO percent limits.

=== Creating an installation token

Administrators can create an installation token without having to share login credentials for an Atom/Molecule installation. To create an installation token, do the following:

. On the *Manage* menu, choose *Atom Management*.
. Choose *New, Molecule*.
. On the *Build* page, choose the *Welcome* tab.
. Under the *Create* heading, choose *Molecule*.
. Choose *Security Options*.
. In the *Token Valid for* field, select the length of time the token is valid (30 minutes to 24 hours).
. Click *Generate Token*.

=== Creating an API token

Administrators can create a long-lived API token without having to share login credentials for an Atom/Molecule installation. To create an user API token, do the following:

. On the *Settings* menu, choose *Account Information and Setup*.
. Choose the *AtomSphere API Tokens* tab.
. Choose *Add New Token*.

[start=3]
. Enter a unique name for the token.

. Choose *Generate Token*.
. Choose *Copy* to copy the token string to the clipboard without exiting. When you are ready to exit, click *Copy to Clipboard & Close* to copy the token string and exit the dialog.

Copy the token key value to a secure location. It is recommended that you treat tokens with the same level of security as you would a password. If you lose it, you will have to generate a new token and revoke the old one.
