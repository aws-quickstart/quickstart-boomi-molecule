.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[architecture1]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets, with Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring.*
* An Application Load Balancer to route traffic to the Boomi Molecule instances in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets:
** Boomi Molecule deployed to four Amazon EC2 instances.
** Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) mount points.
* An Amazon CloudWatch alarm to monitor EC2 instances and initiate recovery actions if an instance fails.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
